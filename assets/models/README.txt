Place bundled on-device models in this folder before building the app.

For the default weak-phone profile used by the app, add:
tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q2_K.gguf

Expected asset path:
assets/models/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.Q2_K.gguf

After adding the file, rebuild the app so it is packaged into the APK/IPA.
